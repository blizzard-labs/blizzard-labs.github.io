## Prior Experience
**Lead Computational Intern  @ Holmes Lab, UC Berkeley**

_JULY 2024 - SEPTEMBER 2025, BERKELEY (STANLEY HALL)_

Worked with  a team of six interns under the apprenticeship of Dr. Ian Holmes for 2024 and 2025 summers; closely worked with post-grads and professors in a lab environment.
- **Summer 2025**: Developed "ReconBench," a benchmarking suite for MCMC evolutionary reconstructors utilizing biologically-inferred statistical models of evolution to generate synthetic datasets capable of precisely measuring performance statistics for development.   
- **Summer 2024**: Worked on data engineering pipelines to map together structural protein data with phylogeny data to identify key evolutionary segments in protein families and visualize them with an integrated protein visualizer.

**Independent Researcher / Engineer**

_JUNE 2022 - PRESENT,  SAN JOSE_

Developed various passion engineering projects presented at science fairs, research symposiums, and hackathons, winning various awards.
- **THALis**: Modeling Cortico-Prosthetic Dynamics for Dexterous EEG-driven Hand Control [IN PROGRESS]
- **MesoNet**: Optimizing Spiking Neural Networks with Dynamic Saddle Distributions [2025, YouTube, Publication Draft]
- **TractX**: A Density-Aware Streamline Exclusion System for Accurate White Matter Reconstruction [2024]
- **Balancerator**: A Wearable for Active Prevention of Falls Through GRU-based Gyroscopic Inference and Center of Mass Manipulation [2023, Youtube, To Be Patented]
In free time, enjoys designing and constructing various passion projects ranging from a Touch-ID protected cookie dispenser to experimental boat designs and walkie-talkies. Loves applying engineering skills to create new inventions.
